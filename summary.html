      <h1>Summary</h1>

      <h2>Final Deliverable</h2>

      <h3></h3>

      <p>My Capstone project started out as an app for college students experiencing food insecurity. This changed to be a mobile first website to connect students with existing resources. 
        A number of factors played into this decision, including the lower cost of owning a phone, accessibility for students using a computer on campus, 
        and the stigma of hunger and poverty that might influence a student’s willingness to download an app. I focused on the user experience process to create a website that is 
        simple and easy to use, limiting the number of screens to avoid “losing” a user.</p>

        <p>A secondary component of the website is a way for the community to support existing campus food pantries; whether it&rsquo;s their alma mater, a local food pantry, 
          or one where they have a personal connection; by donating food, money or time - ultimately creating hope around the issue of college hunger.</p>
        
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>

          <p>Going forward, I don&rsquo;t know where this may live. 
          I believe that a college-specific application is relevant given the insular nature of the college campus community and would love to see this project become a reality.</p>

          <h3>Thoughts on the impact of Covid-19</h3>
          <p>There is a significant increase in need; students are facing lost income, additional expenses for remote learning, and have been excluded from many of the support programs.
          In addition to campus closings, students&rsquo; location is in flux - on campus, off campus, and home.</p>
