      <h1>Summary</h1>

      <h2>Food For Thought</h2>

      <h3>Final Deliverable</h3>

      <p>My Capstone project was created to connect college students who are experiencing food
        insecurity with campus food pantries and community fridges stocked with fresh, healthy food.</p>
        
      <p>Through the user experience process of research, testing, and design, 
        the Food For Thought mobile website is a simple and efficient way for students to achieve this goal.</p>

        <p>The secondary component for the community to support existing campus food pantries; whether its their alma mater, a local food pantry, or one where they have a personal
        connection; with donations of food, money or time is also simple and efficient.</p>

        <p>I contacted Food Finder and the College and University Food Bank Alliance, thinking that combining the existing CUFBA database with FoodFinder's search function was obvious way to 
          collaborate, creating a site specifically for college students. My conversation with Jack Griffin, founder and CEO of FoodFinder, was inspiring and affirmed that I was on the right track
          developing a mobile friendly website first, and developing an app later. He also reiterated that food insecurity for college students is getting more attention but is a serious issue. 
          While CUFBA has not been willing to share their database, FoodFinder has been adding the information on campus food pantries. One of their biggest challenges is entering and maintaining reliable information. 
          I still believe that a college specific application is relevant given the insular nature of the college campus community and would love to see this project become a reality.</p>

        <p>Thoughs on Covid-19 impact on college students. 
          Significant increase in need, campus closings, students' location in flux - on campus, off campus, home.</p>
