      <h1>Summary</h1>

      <h2>Final Deliverable</h2>

      <h3></h3>

      <p>My Capstone project was created to connect college students who are experiencing food
        insecurity with campus food pantries and community fridges stocked with fresh, healthy food.</p>
        
      <p>Through the user experience process of research, testing, and design, 
        the Food For Thought mobile website is a simple and efficient way for students to achieve this goal.</p>

        <p>The secondary component for the community to support existing campus food pantries; whether its their alma mater, a local food pantry, or one where they have a personal
        connection; with donations of food, money or time; is also simple and efficient.</p>

        <p>Going forward, I don&rsquo;t know where this may live. I contacted FoodFinder and the College and University Food Bank Alliance, thinking that combining the existing CUFBA database with FoodFinder's search function was an 
          obvious way to collaborate, creating a site specifically for college students. I still believe that a college-specific application is relevant given the insular nature of the college campus community and would love to see this project become a reality.</p>

        <p>Thoughts on the impact of Covid-19 on college students. There is a significant increase in need; students are facing lost income, additional expenses for remote learning, and have been excluded from many of the support programs.
          In addition to campus closings, students&rsquo; location is in flux - on campus, off campus, home.</p>

        <p>When I started the project, 2017 data indicated 36% of college students were food insecure. In the 2019 #RealCollege survey that number increased to 39%. Food for thought.</p>
