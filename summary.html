      <h1>Summary</h1>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>Hunger has become a significant issue on college and university campuses with over one-third of
        students experiencing food insecurity (defined by The Hope Center as “limited or uncertain availability
        of nutritionally adequate and safe foods”)*. Food insecurity impacts a student’s ability to remain in
        school and earn a degree, which is key to escaping poverty. Middle-class students may joke about
        eating ramen but many students are truly hungry, reducing portion sizes or skipping meals
        altogether. Multiple factors are playing a role - including the rising cost of tuition, reductions in
        financial aid, and increased numbers of first-generation and non-traditional students.</p>

      <p>The unique challenges of addressing hunger are magnified on college campuses - including barriers
      to transportation and very limited income with fewer options to increase it. The first student run
      food pantry was founded in 1993 at Michigan State University. Today, thousands exist on campuses across the country. 
      The College and University Food Bank Alliance alone has over 700 members. The problem
      Food for Thought addresses is the diculty students have locating existing food pantries.</p>

      <p>As a response to hunger during the pandemic and economic crisis, community fridges began
      popping up across the country. The fridges are in public spaces, typically outside of businesses, and
      are open to anyone. Its a simple concept: people place fresh items in fridges and volunteers monitor
      the contents to make sure they’re fresh. If fridge locations are near college campuses they would
      provide students with 24/7 availability to healthy food options. Freedge, a volunteer community
      fridge network started in 2014, has a database of community fridges whose locations would be
      included on the website.</p>

    <h3>My Connection</h3>

      <p>When I became aware of the increasing number of college students experiencing food insecurity I
        knew I wanted to create a project to help alleviate hunger. My own children are currently in college
        and I’ve been engaged in hunger issues in my community, starting a weekend backpack food
        program at the middle school and working with the local food shelp. I understand that we need long
        term policy changes but in the meantime this website creates a more immediate opportunity to
        make a difference in someone’s life.</p>
