      <h1>Research</h1>

      <h2>Questions</h2>

      <h4>Should this be a website vs. an app?</h4>
      <p>More than one person questioned this. To add to the confusion
        two college students said they would prefer an app. Feedback from a UX instructor asked what if the
        student isn’t on a mobile phone, but using a computer in the library.
        <br>Additional research with an executive at a hunger non-profit reiterated the stigma surrounding
        poverty and hunger. Would a student be embarassed if an app was on their phone?</p>

      <h4>What is the problem I’m really trying to address?</h4>
        <p>A conversation with a friend who works as a consultant identified that the issue I was describing was not about hunger per se but about how to connect
      college students to the great resources that already exist.</p>

      <h4>User testing during Covid-19 restrictions?</h4>
      <p>“5 is still the golden rule. Limit testing to 5 users and you’ll uncover the majority of problems that plague your website or app, while still keeping your costs
        low and the process simple.” I struggled to hit the magic number, typically having 3 testers.</p>

      <p>Why 5 is the magic number for UX usability testing, Ellie Martin https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/ux-usability-research-testing/</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>My Capstone project started out as an app to connect college students who are experiencing food
        insecurity with existing campus food pantries and/or community fridges stocked with fresh, healthy
        food. is has changed to be a mobile rst website in response to research with college students and
        people involved in hunger initiatives. A number of factors played into this decision, including the
        lower cost of owning a phone, accessibility for students who might be using a computer in the
        library, and the stigma of hunger and poverty that might inuence a student’s willingness to
        download an app on their phone. I’m focusing on the user experience process to create a website that
        is simple and easy to use, limiting the number of screens to avoid “losing” a user in this critical path.</p>

        <p>A secondary component of the website will be a way for the community to support existing campus
        food pantries; whether its their alma mater, a local food pantry, or one where they have a personal
        connection; with donations of food, money or time - ultimately creating hope around the issue of
        college hunger.</p>
