      <h1>Research</h1>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>My goal is to create a tool that will identify and locate resources for college students
      as well as provide a way for the community to donate - ultimately creating hope around college hunger.</p>
      
      <h2>Keywords</h2>
      <p>hope
        <br>hunger
        <br>food insecurity
        <br>empowering students
        <br>fresh
        <br>healthy
        <br>community
        <br>donate</p>
        
      <h2>Potential Partners</h2>
      <p>Potential partners include the College & University Food Bank Alliance which is focused on alleviating food
        insecurity, hunger, and poverty among college and university students. They have a network of over 700 college 
        food pantries and provide "Getting Started" or "Running a Campus Pantry" toolkits.
        <br><a href="https://cufba.org/" target="_blank">https://cufba.org/</a></p>

        <p>Locally, LeadMN has a hunger-fighting initiative called Hunger Free Campus. To
        achieve the designation a campus must meet certain criteria to help ensure no student goes hungry.
        <br><a href="https://www.leadmn.org/hungerfreecampus" target="_blank">https://www.leadmn.org/hungerfreecampus</a></p>

        <p>Freedge is another potential partner. Freedge promotes the installation of community refrigerators by providing
        resources for finding a “freedge” or starting one in your own community.

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The primary audience for the Food for Thought app would be college students
        in the United States who are experiencing hunger; helping them locate resources for fresh, nutritious food.</p>
      <p>A secondary audience would be members of the community who would like to donate food, money or time.</p>
        
      <h2>Questions</h2>

      <h4>Should this be a website vs. an app?</h4>
      <p>More than one person questioned this. To add to the confusion two college students said they would prefer an app. Feedback from a UX instructor asked what if the
        student isn’t on a mobile phone, but using a computer in the library.
        <br>Additional research with an executive at a hunger non-profit reiterated the stigma surrounding
        poverty and hunger. Would a student be embarassed if an app was on their phone?</p>

      <h4>What is the problem I’m really trying to address?</h4>
        <p>A conversation with a friend who works as a consultant identified that the issue I was describing was not about hunger per se but about how to connect
      college students to the great resources that already exist.</p>

      <h4>User testing during Covid-19 restrictions?</h4>
      <p>How would I conduct testing given limited contact with other people because of Covid-19? Five is considered the magic number for user testing.
        “5 is still the golden rule. Limit testing to 5 users and you’ll uncover the majority of problems that plague your website or app, while still keeping your costs
        low and the process simple.”* I struggled to hit that number, typically having 3 testers.</p>

        <p>*Why 5 is the magic number for UX usability testing, Ellie Martin

      <h2>Like-minded Apps</h2>

      <h4>Food Finder</h4>
      <p>"FoodFinder is designed for use by all the faces of hunger: college students, families struggling due to the COVID-19 crisis, homebound
        seniors, and anyone in need. So when a food pantry requires a photo ID to get help, when you need directions to a pantry via public
        transportation, or you want to know if you can also get clothing or shelter there, FoodFinder has the answers."
        <br><a href="https://foodfinder.us/" target="_blank">https://foodfinder.us/</a></p>
        
        <h4>Got Food?</h4>
        <p><i>"Got Food?</i> through Feeding America, is a resource to introduce nearby food pantries and soup
        kitchens to iOS users. The app consolidates data from multiple locations and will continue to expand its database of organizations.
        Our mission is to minimize the effects of food insecurity in our local communities."
        <br><a href="https://hungerandhealth.feedingamerica.org/" target="_blank">https://hungerandhealth.feedingamerica.org/</a></p>

        <p>Some additional apps, including some at colleges:
        <br>plentiful
        <br>CSUDH Eats
        <br>Beach Bites
        <br>Bronco BEAM</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>As a result of this research, the project was changed to be a mobile first website instead of an app. Food for Thought would contain 
        the information of more than 700 food pantries on college campuses in the United States, helping students quickly locate and access 
        fresh, healthy food near them.</p>
      <p>A second component would be a way to support these existing programs with donations.</p>
      <p>I focused on creating a simple, efficient way to connect college students with a campus food pantry near them, eliminating screens 
        to reduce the chances of “losing” a user as they clicked through the site.</p>
